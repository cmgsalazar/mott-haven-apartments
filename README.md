# Mott Haven (Port Morris) apartments 

This repository contains data from various sources in relation to luxury apartments and new developments in the Port Morris / Mott Haven neighborhood in the South Bronx. 

Data scraping work is in partial fulfillment of my requirements for the **Practical Python for News Investigations** class under [Sandeep Junnarkar](https://github.com/sandeepmj) at the Craig Newmark J-school. The resulting data will be used for my report for the [Mott Haven Herald](https://motthavenherald.com/).
